# VersaTrade

VersaTrade is a decentralized PvP wagering platform built on the Arc Testnet. It enables two players to enter a match with a staked bet, and the winner automatically receives the full prize minus a small platform fee. The platform focuses on making skill-based, trustless competition simple, transparent, and secure.

## Why Arc

Arc provides fast settlement, low fees, and EVM compatibility, making it ideal for gaming applications like VersaTrade. Its developer environment makes on-chain gameplay interactions efficient and flexible.

## Challenges Encountered

We ran into a few difficulties during development, including scattered documentation split between Arc and Circle, unstable RPC responses, and inconsistencies when working with wallets and gateway flows. These issues slowed down testing and debugging, especially with limited time.

## Future Improvements

- Full integration of Bridge Kit for cross-chain features  
- More dynamic matchmaking and ranking systems  
- Expanded UI/UX for gameplay and player profiles  
- Better on-chain analytics and event tracking
